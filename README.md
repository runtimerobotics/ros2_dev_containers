# Devcontainers for Simulation, Navigation, Manipulation

**Devcontainers** are portable, reproducible development environments defined using configuration files. They allow developers to easily share and run consistent setups for tools, libraries, and dependencies inside isolated containers.

## Features

- 🛠 **Simulation:** Run and test simulation scenarios in an isolated environment.
- 🗺️ **Navigation:** Develop and test navigation pipelines reproducibly.
- 🤖 **Manipulation:** Build, test, and iterate on robotic manipulation modules.
